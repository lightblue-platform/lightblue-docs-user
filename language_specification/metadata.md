# Metadata

## Entity Metadata
Entity metadata are stored in a collection named "metadata". Format of metadata is:

```javascript
{
    "entityInfo": {
        "_id": String,
        "name": String,
        "hooks": [ hook ],
        "indexes": [ index ],
        "enums": [ enum ],
        "datastore":  datastore_info,
        "defaultVersion": string
    },
    "schema": {
        "_id": String,
        "name": String,
        "version": version,
        "status": Status,
        "access": entity_access,
        "fields": { fields_object },
        "constraints": [ constraint ]
    }
}
```

## Entity Info

* entityInfo: data about an entity that is not versioned
  *  `_id`: &lt;name&gt;|
  *  `name`: Name of the entity.  Name is the same in entityInfo and schema sections.
  *  `hooks`: array of individual hook objects

```javascript
    "hooks": [
        {
            "name": hook implementation name,
            "projection": optional, applied against both request and response data, see CRUD spec,
            "configuration": optional, hook specific configuration details,
            "actions": one or more of "insert", "update", "find", and "delete"
        }
    ]
```
   *  `indexes`: array of index information.  Each index is an array of fields to index

```javascript
    "indexes": [
        {
            "name": optional name of the index,
            "unique": flag to indicate if index is a unique constraint.  if not specified defaults to 'false',
            "fields": [ { "field":"fieldName", "dir":"$asc" },  ... ] Array with fields (paths) that are part of the index
        }
    ]
```
   *  `enums`: definition of enumerations (aka value sets) that are referenced from schema

```javascript
    "enums": [
        {
            "name": name of the enumeration,
            "values": array of enum values
        }
    ]
```

   *  `datastore`: Datastore object. The actual object implementation depends on the backend. Below is for mongoDB. collection field is required. Other fields are implementation specific.

```javascript
    "datastore" : {
        "backend" : "mongo",
        "datasource" : logical name for the datasource,
        "database" : database name
        "collection" : collection name
    }
```

* `defaultVersion`: Optional field that indicate the version of the entity used by default if no version is specified by the client.  Note that if this field is not set and the client does not supply a version the request will fail.


## Schema

* schema: data about an entity that is versioned
  *  _id: &lt;name&gt;|&lt;version&gt;
  *  name: Name of the entity.  Name is the same in entityInfo and schema sections.
  *  version: The version data for the metadata
     *  value - the version string [required]
     *  extendVersions - array of version values this version extends (implies merges) [optional]
     *  changelog - text describing the version  [required]

```javascript
"version" : {
    "value": String,
    "extendVersions": [ String, ... ],
    "changelog": String
}
```

   * status: Entity metadata status
```javascript
    "status" : {
      "value": one of "active", "deprecated", or "disabled",
      "log": [
        { "date": date,
          "value": String,
          "comment": String }, ... ]
    }
```
   *  fields: object with fields that define the model for the entity.  Structure is based on json schema v4-draft.  See metadata schema.
   *  entity_access: entity access object. Determines the access rights of the entity
```javascript
    "access": {
      "insert": [role1, role2, ...],
      "find": [role1,role2,...],
      "update": [role1,role2,...],
      "delete": [role1,role2,...]
    }
```

If the caller does not have the required role for the operation, a
(not allowed) error entity will be returned constraints: array of
entity constraint objects. Custom constraints can be defined, and
parsers/handlers can be registered for processing. Each constraint is
an object containing one field. The field name determines the
constraint type. Depending on the constraint, the constraintInfo can
be a simple value, an array, or an object:
```javascript
       { "constraintName" : constraintInfo  }
```


### fields_object

* "name": name of the field, this is the property name in the json document
* type: one of:
   *  basic types: boolean, integer (64-bit int), string, double, biginteger, bigdecimal, date, binary, uid
       * If a field is defined as biginteger, or bigdecimal in metadata, store the value as string, and don't allow &lt; &gt; operators during search.operators are not supported for this field during search.
       * binary - an open-ended data type for storing binary data, it is recommended that each use of this field clearly indicates what encoding is used.  For example, in java using DatatypeConverter.printBase64Binary(byte[]) the encoding spec is http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#base64Binary.  Note there are limits on document sizes, see [MongoDB Limits and Thresholds](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/limits/#BSON-Document-Size) documentation.
       * uid - unique identifier field that can be used anywhere within a document, specifically created to support identity of array elements. If an uid field is not initialized or null, then upon inserting/updating the document, the uid field is initialized to a unique string value. If a uid field has value during insert/update, it is not modified.
   * date: Re: How will we represent date in JSON?
   * a container type: object, array
* fields: If type=object, an array of field objects
* items: If type=array, an object of the form:
```javascript
    "items" : {
      "type": type
      "fields" : { ... } (if type=object)
    }
```
* reference: If type=object or array. If reference is present, fields and elements cannot be given. Determines a query, projection, and sort order for another entity to be inserted into the document
```javascript
    "reference" : {
      "entity": entityName,
      "versionValue": versionValue,
      "projection": projection_expression,
      "query": query_expression,
      "sort": sort
    }
```
* access: field access object. Determines the access rights of the field
```javascript
    "access" : {
       "find" : [ role1, role2, ... ],
       "insert": [ role1, role2, ...],
       "update": [ role1, role2, ... ]
    }
```

  *  find: If the caller does not have the required role, the field is removed from the return value
  *  update: If the caller does not have the required role, the field will not be updated. Attempt to update inaccessible fields will result in failed update
  *  insert: If the caller does not have the required role, attempt to set field value during insertion will result in failed insert.
*  constraints: array of field constraint objects
   *  minLength, maxLength for strings (minLength=1 is to be used to mean nonempty string)
```javascript
    { "minLength" : value }
    { "maxLength" : value }
```
   *  minItems and maxItems limit number of items in an array.  Default is 0 to unlimited.
```javascript
    { "minItems": value }
    { "maxItems": value }
```
   *  required: boolean indicating if the field is required, default is false.
```javascript
    { "required": true|false }
```
   * minimum/maximum (for number types)
```javascript
    { "minimum": value }
    { "maximum": value }
```
   *  enum reference where the enum name comes from entityInfo
```javascript
    { "enum": enum name }
```
   * references: denotes fields in other entities this field depends on. The constraint requires that if this field value is non-null, there must be an instance of entity with { entityField: thisField }
```javascript
    {
        "references": {
           "entityName": entityName,
           "versionValue": version.value
           "entityField": fieldName
        }
    }
```


*  hooks: optional array of enums that define what hooks are triggered when CRUD operations are performed on this field. Hooks are invoked in the given sequence.
   *  Values can be "audit" or "publish" at this time.  See How will events for create, update, and delete be sent to the ESB?
```javascript
    {
        "hooks": {
            "insert":[value1...],
            "update": [value1...],
            "delete": [value1...]
        }
    }
```

### Predefined Fields

The following fields are stored with every entity. If the metadata
defines these as fields, they are exposed to the callers. Otherwise,
these fields will not be exposed.


*  &lt;arrayField&gt;#: arrayField is an array field of the entity. The variable &lt;arrayField&gt;# keeps the number of elements in the array
  * Type: int
  * read-only

* object_type: Entity type
  * Type: string
  * read-only
