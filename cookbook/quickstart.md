# Quickstart
This section's intent is to show how you can:
* Install lightblue on [OpenShift](http://openshift.com)
* Create your first entity metadata
* Insert some data into your entity
* Find the data you inserted

Note there is no requirement to use lightblue on OpenShift.  If you have an instance setup somewhere else you can skip that step.
